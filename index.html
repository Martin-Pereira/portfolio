					<p>I like art, in all it’s different<br />flavours. I also like to draw.</p>
					<p>But more than that I like to use things that look nice. I mean, who doesn’t? I never lose sight of the original message and how it may be<br />interpreted by the end user. I hope that I can always look at something I’ve designed and say<br />‘I’d like to use that’.</p>
					<p>Apart from my aptitude for typography and my awareness of space and colour, I like to doodle and use my imagination. That’s what has fuelled all my best designs. That and the deep down urge to be better than everyone else.</p>
					<p>Overall, this side of my brain is obsessed with staying current with web trends and imagining<br />the future.</p>

					<p>I love solving puzzles.
					Logic puzzles, games, riddles
					and, more importantly, problems!
					After all, that is what our clients come to us for, amirite?</p>
					<p>I like to spend a little extra time making sure my
					code is semantic, well structured and forward-thinking. I have found that working like this usually saves me alot of time further down the line.</p>
					<p>I love technology in general. I often spend my personnal time cramming in as much tech knowledge as possible. I’m currently getting my head around node.js [link: http://nodejs.org].</p>
					<p>To summarise, this side of my brain is posessed by finding out how everything works and staying up-to-date with the latest in web technology.</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="glassSheet">
				<p>I'm Martin, I’m a long haired, 30 year-old senior agency creative. A passionate leader with a proclivity for translating complex ideas into slick, successful campaigns.</p>
				<p>I’m a born and bred londoner who likes to design and build websites, apps and the like. A creative, yet logical thinker that’s easy to get along with. I graduated with a degree from the University of Arts London (Camberwell College).</p>
				<p>I currently work at Creative Impact, a small agency in Twickenham that specialises in healthcare, where I have been for the last four years. Here, I am the Lead Designer, Lead Developer and Server Administrator. Amongst designing and coding, I also oversee a small team, manage suppliers, engage with clients and manage thier expectations.Working here has made me a versatile, agile worker that can slot in to any project, at any stage. As a result, I can meet short deadlines, work under pressure and it has led me to learn many assets of project deleopment. I also do a little freelancing in my spare time.</p>
				<p>When I'm not coding or pushing pixels, you'll probably find me in the cinema or in the pub.</p>
				<p>I specialise in website development, concept and identity. I create beautiful, usable, professional websites and apps using modern best practices.My code is semantic and seo friendly HTML and CSS, all of which are lovingly hand coded.</p>
				<p>Key areas of experience include Website Development, App Development, Creative Direction, Art Direction and Senior-Level Design in Print, Digital, User Experience and Usability, Identity, Branding, Brand Management, Illustration, Animation and Audio Mixing. I have also been known to play guitar and keyboard from time to time.</p>
				<p>Yeah, so, I pretty much do everything. Next, perhaps I should tackle making the web 3D!</p>
